# 2048 Project
This project was made by Victor Daviau and Parsa Farjam for the CS 111 Imperative Programming course at Paris-Saclay University. As this course was in French, all of the comments used in the code and the variable names we chose are in French, although we stuck to English for the Pull Requests, Issues and Commit Messages. 

## What is it?
It is a recreation of the famous 2048 game in C++. It can be either played in graphical mode or in any UNIX-based console. It is made uniquely using standard C++ libraries (except `SDL` which is used to render the GUI).

## Featrues
- Graphical and Terminal modes
- Theme selector (available in Terminal only)
- Score calculator
